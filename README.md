# My Personal Researches

This repository is used to track the progress of my personal researches.

## How it works

I use [Github Issues](https://github.com/pomodorozhong/personal-research/issues) to capture topics which I'm interested. And then I use [Github Projects](https://github.com/pomodorozhong/personal-research/projects) to arrange topics I'm about to work on.

During the research, If there is any result that is worth noting, I'll commit it to the repository.
