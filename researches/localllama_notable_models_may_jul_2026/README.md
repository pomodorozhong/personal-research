# Notable Local Models You Can Run on a 16GB M2 MacBook Pro

**Window:** mid-May → mid-July 2026  
**Hardware target:** Apple **M2 MacBook Pro, 16 GB unified memory** (Metal / MLX / llama.cpp / Ollama — **no CUDA**)  
**Source:** [r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/), filtered to releases that actually fit this machine  
**Compiled:** 2026-07-16

## Your real memory budget

16 GB unified ≠ 16 GB for the model.

- macOS + browser + IDE typically leave **~8–11 GB** usable for weights + KV cache.
- Metal’s default GPU working set on ≤32–64 GB Macs is often ~**10.5 GB**.
- Prefer GGUF/MLX quants whose **on-disk size is ≤ ~8 GB**; keep context **4K–8K** unless you’ve measured headroom.
- If a file is **>11 GB**, expect swap and sluggish single-digit tok/s — treat those as “does not run” for daily use.

## Comparison vs Gemma 4 12B Unified (encoder-free)

**Baseline:** [google/gemma-4-12B](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-4-12B) — the **12B Unified** variant. It has **no separate vision/audio encoders** (unlike Gemma 4 E2B/E4B/31B). Image patches and audio map through lightweight projections into one decoder-only transformer. ~**11.95B** params, **256K** context, **Apache 2.0**, text + image + audio (+ video frames).

Google positions it as laptop-ready: Q4 weights ~**6.7 GB**, recommended **16 GB** unified/VRAM. On an M2 16 GB that is workable for **short–medium context**, not a full 256K window.

### Specs side-by-side

### Quality (published / vendor tables — not identical harnesses)

Agentic coding numbers below are from Ornith’s model card (same table includes Gemma4-12B). Reasoning numbers for Gemma are Google’s official card.

### Who wins what on your M2

| Goal | Pick | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Screenshots / PDFs / voice in one model** | **Gemma 4 12B Unified** | Only mid-size option here with native text+image+audio and **no encoder tax** |
| **Repo coding / terminal agents** | **Ornith-1.0-9B** | Large gap on SWE / Terminal-Bench vs Gemma 12B |
| **Fast general chat, max headroom** | **Qwen ~9B** or **Agents-A1-4B** | Smaller/faster; more RAM left for IDE + context |
| **Portuguese / local-language national model** | **Amalia 9B** | Niche fit; don’t expect Ornith-level coding |
| **Best single default if you want one file** | **Gemma 4 12B** *or* **Ornith-9B** | Gemma if multimodal daily; Ornith if you code locally |

**Practical M2 note:** Gemma’s “fits in 16 GB” is true for weights at Q4, but multimodal prompts + thinking mode + long context eat the same shared pool. For coding-only sessions, Ornith Q4 leaves more breathing room than Gemma Q4.

### Ornith-1.0-9B (DeepReinforce) — coding pick

Released ~2026-06-25. Use the **9B dense** only (35B MoE does **not** fit).

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Size** | ~9B dense |
| **License** | MIT |
| **CUDA?** | No — Metal / MLX |
| **Memory** | Q4_K_M ~**5.6 GB** · Q5 ~**6.5** · Q6 ~**7.4** · Q8 ~**9.5** (tight) |
| **Context** | Keep **≤8K** on 16 GB for comfort |
| **Throughput** | Mid/high tens tok/s plausible at Q4 on Apple Silicon; M2 slower than M4 |
| **vs Gemma 12B** | Much stronger SWE/Terminal-Bench; **no** native audio/vision |

---

### Amalia 9B (Portugal)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **When** | ~2026-07-03 |
| **Memory** | Q4 ~**5–6 GB** |
| **vs Gemma 12B** | Smaller, text-focused national model; not a multimodal or coding leader |

---

### Agents-A1-4B (InternScience)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Size** | ~4B |
| **Memory** | Q4 ~**2.5–3.5 GB** |
| **vs Gemma 12B** | Far less general capability; wins on footprint and latency for simple agent loops |

### Qwen ~9B class

Qwen3.6-**27B** is out of scope. Small Qwen (≈7–9B) still fits.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Memory** | Q4–Q6 ~**4.5–8 GB** |
| **vs Gemma 12B** | Leaner/faster for text; weaker native audio/video story; coding usually between Gemma 12B and Ornith 9B on agent benches (Qwen3.5-9B SWE-Verified **53.2** vs Gemma **44.2** vs Ornith **69.4**) |

---

## Specialists (not full LLM substitutes)

| Model | Job | vs Gemma 12B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Unlimited-OCR 3.3B** | Doc OCR | Narrower but dedicated; Gemma already has solid OmniDocBench-class vision OCR |
| **OvisOCR2 0.8B** | Tiny doc VLM | Use when you want OCR only and maximum RAM left over |
| **Inflect-Nano / Gepard TTS** | Speech out | Gemma does speech-*in*; these are TTS |
| **Local Image→3D (&lt;2 GB)** | 3D generation | Different task entirely |

---

## Quant / runtime cheat sheet (M2 16 GB)

| On-disk size | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| ≤ 6 GB | Comfortable |
| 6–9 GB | OK with **4K–8K** context (Gemma Q4 lives here) |
| 9–11 GB | Fragile |
| &gt; 11 GB | Skip for daily use |

**Preferred stack:** Ollama / LM Studio (Metal) or **MLX** when available. Avoid CUDA-only NVFP4 server recipes.

## Method / caveats

- Shortlist = r/LocalLLaMA May–Jul 2026 releases that fit ~**8–11 GB** usable on a 16 GB M2, with **Gemma 4 12B Unified** as the comparison baseline.
- Coding table numbers are from Ornith’s published comparison (harness details on their card); Gemma reasoning/vision numbers are from Google’s model card — **not** one unified eval.
