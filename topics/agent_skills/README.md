# Agent Skills

An agent skill is a folder of instructions and supporting files that helps an AI agent carry out a particular task. These guides explain what goes in that folder, how agents find and use skills, and how to share them. A document-generation example shows how the pieces fit together.

The [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) defines the shared file format. Each product has its own rules for finding, starting, installing, and sharing skills. Product details in these guides were checked on 2026-09-29. Check the linked documentation for later changes.
